# Chip-8 Emulator
This project consists of a barebones webserver that serves a page
hosting a Chip-8 Emulator.

At the moment, we are following a guide to implement the emulator
in javascript. Once we implement it in javascript, we will go back
and attempt to port the emulator into Rust and serve it using 
WASM.
